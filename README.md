### Setup for development

#### Step 1:

Clone the boilerplate

```bash
git clone https://github.com/petatemarvin26/react-webpack.git . # through https
git clone git@github.com:petatemarvin26/react-webpack.git . # through ssh
```

#### Step 2:

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install # if you are using node package manager
yarn install # if using yarn packacge manager
```

#### Step 3:

Environment variables

```bash
touch .env # .env PORT=4321 HOST=1.2.3.4
```

> NOTE: arbitrary build with env is base on the env `variant` at npm script `.env.dev`

#

### Configure into Javascript

#### Step 1:

Rename the javascript configuration file from `tsconfig.json` to `jsconfig.json`

#### Step 2:

Install the `babel-plugin-module-resolver`

```bash
npm i -D babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

#### Step 3:

Implement module resolver on our [config/.babelrc][babelrc] to resolving the relative path from `jsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "plugins": [["module-resolver", {"root": ["./src"]}]]
}
```

#### Step 4:

Change the entry file from `index.tsx` to `index.jsx` at [webpack.config.js][webpack-config]

```Javascript
const entry = {
  index: './index.jsx'
};
```

#### Step 5:

Lets clean up!, uninstall the `tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin` and remove all related implementation to this library, dont forget `typescript` as well

#### Step 6:

Now you can start the bundler using `npm start`

> NOTE: please uninstall unnecessary libraries in node_modules after configuration
